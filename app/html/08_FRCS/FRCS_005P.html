					<strong>Privacy Policy 
						Last Updated: Dec 11, 2025</strong>

This Privacy Policy explains how ATON INC. (“ATON,” "company," "we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, stores, protects, and shares personal information when you use the Child Safety Guardian application and related services ("Service").
By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
 
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<strong>1.1 Account Information</strong>
We collect and process:
•	Parent/guardian account details (email, phone number, password)
•	Child profile information (name/nickname, birth year, device identifiers)

<strong>1.2 Location Information</strong>
To provide core safety features, we collect:
•	GPS coordinates
•	Wi-Fi signal information
•	Cell-tower identifiers
•	Motion/acceleration data
•	Background location data (even when the app is closed, if permission is granted)

<strong>1.3 Device & Usage Information</strong>
We collect device and diagnostic data, including:
•	Device model, OS version, unique identifiers
•	Battery level, network status
•	App activity logs and crash logs
Retention: Logs are kept for 90 days and deleted or anonymized thereafter.

<strong>1.4 Surrounding Sound (Ambient Audio)</strong>
If the parent activates the “Live Surrounding Sound” feature:
•	Short-duration audio samples are temporarily captured by the child’s device and transmitted in real time to the parent’s device
•	When this feature is activated, the child’s device will display a clear on-screen notification indicating that ambient audio is being shared, so the child is aware that the microphone is in use for real-time audio transmission.
By enabling this feature, the parent confirms compliance with all applicable audio-recording, consent, and surveillance laws, including two-party/all-party consent jurisdictions, where applicable. 
We do not store, retain, or archive any audio data on our servers after transmission is completed. However, audio received on the parent’s device may be stored on that device depending on the parent’s settings and installed applications, which is outside of our control. Any storage, copying, or sharing of audio on the parent’s device is solely under the parent’s control and responsibility. ATON has no access to, and cannot delete or manage, any such stored audio. The parent or guardian is solely responsible for using this feature in a way that complies with the monitoring, recording, privacy, and other applicable laws in the country or region where they and the child are located. We do not provide legal advice and we are not responsible for any unlawful use of this feature.

<strong>1.5 Communication & Alerts</strong>
We collect:
•	SOS events
•	Geofence events
•	Parent-child notification logs
•	Movement and activity history (retained for 90 days)

<strong>1.6 Payment Information</strong>
Payments are handled through Apple App Store or Google Play.
We do not collect or store full payment or credit card information.
 

<h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>

•	Improve accuracy through device and environmental data

•	Support customer service and technical troubleshooting
•	Prevent fraud, misuse, and security incidents
•	Fulfill legal obligations
We do not use children’s data for advertising, profiling, or marketing.
 

<h2>3. Legal Basis of Processing</h2>
<strong>3.1 Depending on the jurisdiction, processing of personal data may be based on:</strong>
•	Consent (e.g., location, microphone)

•	Legal obligations

<strong>3.2 The company has appointed a Data Protection Officer whose email address is as follows:  privacy@atoncorp.com</strong>
<strong>3.3 As the data controller for a Service that involves the large-scale and systematic monitoring of individuals, ATON conducts regular Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)</strong>
 

<h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>

•	Children cannot create standalone accounts.
•	We do not serve behavioral or targeted ads to children.
•	Parents may access, modify, or delete their child's data at any time.
•	If data is collected from a child without proper consent, it will be deleted immediately.
 

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
We retain data only as long as necessary:

•	Audio samples: never stored; deleted immediately after transmission
•	App activity & error logs: retained for 90 days
•	Account data: fully deleted 30 days after account deletion request

We follow an automated data deletion process. Personal data stored on our servers is automatically deleted or anonymized once the applicable retention period expires, without any manual intervention.
•	Location history, movement data, app activity logs, and diagnostic data are automatically deleted or anonymized within 90 days of collection.
•	When a user requests account deletion (by selecting the “Delete Account” option in the in-app Settings menu or by contacting us at privacy@atoncorp.com), all associated account information is placed into a 30-day grace period to prevent accidental loss or fraud, after which it is permanently erased from our production systems.
•	Certain copies of data may remain in encrypted backup archives for up to 90 days after deletion, for system integrity and disaster-recovery purposes; such copies are automatically purged as part of our scheduled backup overwrite process.
All deletion is performed automatically by the Service infrastructure, and no further retention or manual review occurs once deletion is triggered. We do not retain deleted personal data beyond the specified retention duration, except where longer retention is legally required (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution, or compliance).
Users may request full deletion at any time. Certain data may remain in backups for up to 90 days for security and disaster-recovery purposes, after which it is automatically purged. Furthermore, certain data may be retained for a longer period where required by applicable laws, including, but not limited to, for fraud prevention, dispute resolution, and/or compliance purposes.

Data may be stored or processed on servers located in multiple countries. Depending on your location, your data may be transferred to and processed in the following regions: United States, European Union, South Korea, or other locations where the company or its service providers maintain infrastructure. 

Transfers follow widely accepted international standards and safeguards.
