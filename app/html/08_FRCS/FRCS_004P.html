					<strong>Terms of Use
					Last Updated: Dec 11, 2025</strong>

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Child Safety Guardian mobile application and related services (the “Service”) provided by ATON INC. (“ATON,” “company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).

By downloading, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
 
<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
1.	You must be at least 18 years old to create a parent/guardian account.
2.	Child accounts may be created only by a parent or legal guardian.
3.	By using the Service, you confirm you have lawful authority to manage and monitor the child’s device.
4.	By creating an account, you represent and warrant that all information you provide is accurate and that you have full legal authority under applicable laws to monitor the child’s device and communications. ATON does not independently verify such authority and assumes no liability for users who misrepresent their legal relationship to a monitored child. 


<h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
The Service provides parental monitoring and child-safety features, including:
• Real-time child location tracking (GPS, Wi-Fi, cell towers)
• Location history and movement path review
• Safe Zone (geofence) alerts
• Emergency SOS and rapid parent-child alerts
• Harmful message detection, provided on an ‘as-is’ basis which may not detect all harmful content
• Ambient audio (“Live Surrounding Sound”) requested by the parent
• Device status information (battery, network, system indicators)
• Safety alerts, recommendations, and notifications

For purposes of the Service, a “Harmful Message” means a communication, message, text, or content that may relate to bullying, harassment, profanity, hate speech, sexual content, self-harm, suicide, violence, illegal activities, or other socially harmful or inappropriate topics, based on keyword or pattern-matching methods implemented within the Service. 
 The detection of Harmful Messages is performed through automated keyword analysis and other heuristics, and does not involve semantic comprehension, contextual analysis, sentiment interpretation, or human review. As such, the Service may identify content as harmful where no actual harm exists (false positives), or may fail to detect actual harmful content (false negatives). 
 The detection feature is provided solely as a supplementary safety tool to assist parents or guardians and is not intended to replace active parental supervision, judgment, or intervention. The Company does not warrant or guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of any Harmful Message detection results.

Features may be added, changed, or removed over time. Please note that certain features, including, but not limited to, ambient audio, background location, harmful message detection, and communication monitoring, may be restricted, disabled, or modified in specific jurisdictions due to local privacy, consent, and surveillance laws.
 

<h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
<strong>3.1 Parent/Guardian Accounts</strong>
• You must provide accurate information.
• You are responsible for securing your login credentials.

<strong>3.2 Child Accounts</strong>
• Must be created only by parents/legal guardians.
• You must not monitor any individual without lawful authority.
 

<h2>4. Permitted Use</h2>
You may use the Service only for lawful child-safety purposes.
You must NOT:
• Track or monitor adults without consent/legal authority
• Use the Service for harassment, stalking, or surveillance
• Resell, copy, distribute, modify, or attempt reverse engineering
- Reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or decrypting the Service is prohibited except as permitted by applicable law
• Interfere with or disrupt servers or system operations
• Bypass or disable security features
Violations may lead to account suspension and legal consequences.
You agree not to use the Service in any manner that violates any applicable laws, including, but not limited to, laws requiring all-party consent for audio recording.
 

<h2>5. Location Data</h2>
To operate core safety features, the Service collects precise and background location data from parent and child devices, including:
• GPS coordinates
• Wi-Fi signals
• Cell-tower identifiers
• Background location (with permission)
Disabling location permissions may cause the Service to malfunction. Location accuracy may vary depending on device hardware, environmental conditions, network performance, and third-party limitations. ATON does not guarantee precise or real-time accuracy. 
 

<h2>6. Live Surrounding Sound (Ambient Audio)</h2>
The parent may request a short, real-time audio sample from the child’s device.
By using this feature, you confirm:
• You are the lawful guardian
• You will use the feature solely for child-safety
• You comply with local monitoring and privacy laws
Audio data is transmitted in real time and is not stored on our servers.
For the avoidance of doubt, ATON does not authorize recording of any adult. 
 

<h2>7. Data Collection & Privacy</h2>
Your use of the Service is governed by our Privacy Policy, which describes:
• What personal data is collected
• How it is used and stored
• Data retention periods

You must review the Privacy Policy before using the Service.
 

<h2>8. Subscription & Payments</h2>

• Payments are processed through Google Play / Apple App Store
• Refunds follow each store’s policy
• Subscriptions may auto-renew unless canceled in advance
ATON does not store full payment card information.
 

<h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
We strive for continuous service but do not guarantee:
• Uninterrupted access
• Error-free operation
• Precise accuracy of location or device data
Maintenance or updates may temporarily interrupt the Service.
 

<h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
The Service may rely on third-party providers, including:
• Mobile OS providers
• Mapping/geolocation providers
• Cloud hosting services
We do not control or guarantee the performance of third-party services. Use of such third-party services may require the transfer of limited technical data solely for functionality, as described in our Privacy Policy.
ATON is not liable for outages, inaccuracies, policy changes, or discontinuation of features resulting from third-party updates or service interruptions.
 

<h2>11. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
You must not:
• Engage in illegal use of the Service
• Violate privacy rights of others

<h2>12. Termination</h2>
We may suspend or terminate accounts and pursue any and all legal options available to us, if:
• You violate these Terms
• You misuse monitoring functions
• You engage in fraudulent or harmful behavior
Users may delete their account at any time.
After deletion, data is retained for 30 days, then permanently erased.
 

<h2>13. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.”
We disclaim all warranties, including:
• Accuracy of location data
• Reliability of network/GPS signals
• Fitness for any particular purpose
You use the Service at your own risk.
Harmful message detection and safety alerts are not guaranteed to identify all risks, messages, or harmful content and should not be relied on as a substitute for active parental supervision.
 

<h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, ATON is not liable for:
• Service interruptions
• Data inaccuracies
• Unauthorized access caused by user negligence
• Damages arising from illegal or improper monitoring
• Technical failures beyond our control
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the company’s total cumulative liability hereunder or the Privacy Policy, or in relation to the Service, shall not exceed the total amount paid by that user in the twelve months preceding the claim. 
 

<h2>15. Indemnification</h2>
You agree to indemnify and hold ATON harmless from claims arising from:
• Your misuse of the Service
• Your violation of these Terms
• Monitoring without legal authority
 

<h2>16. Modifications</h2>
We may update these Terms from time to time.
Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.
 

<h2>17. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea.
All disputes arising out of or in relation to the Service, these Terms or the Privacy Policy will be submitted exclusively to the Seoul Central District Court in South Korea.
You and aton agree that each party may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding. You and aton further agree that no judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The foregoing applies to any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or in relation to the service, these terms, or the privacy policy.
